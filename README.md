This is my first FullStack project!
It's a Simple Blog app with 1 Backend API created with ExpressJS, and 2 frontends created with React!
First frontend is for normal users, blog visitors, Live link: https://blog-page-3antozz.vercel.app/
Second frontend is for authors, to create and edit posts and comments, Live link: https://authors-page.vercel.app/, (you need to be an admin to login on this, use the following account: username: 3antozz, password: 123456).
This is a monorepo, so everything is in this Repo!
